# EulerMethodOfek
This is a program I made as a challenge to myself to study Euler's method off of a video on youtube as well as programming the mathmatical algorithm into my own program. 
I made this program after I finished Calculus AB back in 2020. Doing this project iteratively was an interesting way of programming this for me because I programmed a basic 
Newton's Method program using recursion.
